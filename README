WHAT
~~~~

This module is intended for low-resolution or high-resolution graphics
using gnuplot low-level functions. Documentation is at the start of
the .pm file.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
You may need to edit LIBS line in Makefile.PL, and INC and CFLAGS lines
in gnuterm/Makefile.PL (as based on the included platform-specific
makefiles and READMEs in ./gnuterm directory), but if you do not
wish to support platform-specific terminals, this should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
		(Check whether you are satisfied with the result.)
	make install

If you needed some changed, and can automate them, please send patches to
the address below.  Currently the defines HAVE_LIBGD, HAVE_LIBPNG,
LINUXVGA, EMXVESA are automatically set to reasonable values.  X11 and DEBUG
terminals are always included.  Gnuplot 3.7 would also use 

 AMIGA ATARI MTOS _Macintosh DJGPP __ZTC__ PC NEXT APOLLO GPR IRIS MGR RGIP
 SCO SUN UIS UNIXPC UNIXPLOT GNUGRAPH DEBUG

Note that for some term types (such as X11, or PM) additional binaries are
needed.  They should be available if gnuplot is already installed on your
system.

CHANGES
~~~~~~~
0.2: Test added.
0.3: Part of gnuplot3.5 distribution included to make it
	into turnkey installation, tested on OS/2, Solaris.
0.4: list_terms() added;
     interactive test for different terminals;
0.41:
     change_term_address(), term_tbl_address() added;

0.5:	uses Gnuplot 3.6pre built 340 (with a tiny patch, included);
	change_term returns 1 on success, 0 on failure;
0.51:	Does not need any change to Gnuplot source files.
0.55:	Updated to latest Gnuplot.h from PARI 2.0.13 (with do_init => init).
	setpointsize works now.
	set_gnuplot_fh() removed, replaced by plot_outfile_set().
	Updated to version 3.7.
	stdfn.c needed too...
	setpointsize(0.25) instead of pointsize().
	GD terminal was coring, since it required calling option before plot.
0.56:	Better docs, DEBUG terminal.
	Setup a line buffer for options() so that gnuplot error reporting
	works better.
	New functions plotsizes_scale(), term_init(), term_start_plot(),
	term_end_plot(), term_start_multiplot(), term_end_multiplot().
	New C API setup_gpshim().
	POD for Terminals.
0.5601: syscfg.h was not \n-terminated
	SET_OUTFILE() had wrong precedence of `,'.
