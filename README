WHAT
~~~~

This module is intended for low-resolution or high-resolution graphics
using gnuplot low-level functions. Documentation is at the start of
the .pm file.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
You may need to edit LIBS line in Makefile.PL, and INC and CFLAGS lines
in gnuterm/Makefile.PL (as based on the included platform-specific
makefiles and READMEs in ./gnuterm directory), but if you do not
wish to support platform-specific terminals, this should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
		(Check whether you are satisfied with the result.)
	make install

By default, the following libs are tried to be found:

  -L/usr/openwin/lib -lX11 -lm  -lsocket -lvga -llinuxvga \
    -lgd -lpng -lz -ljmgraph -lvesa

You may change this by putting TRY_LIBS=new_specs on the command line
of Makefile.PL.  (Say, I needed to remove -lgd since the header file
gd.h was for a newer version of gd than the library, and Term::Gnuplot
could not determine the version of gd correctly.)

If you needed some changed, and can automate them, please send patches to
the address below.  Currently the defines HAVE_LIBGD, HAVE_LIBPNG,
LINUXVGA, EMXVESA are automatically set to reasonable values.  X11 and DEBUG
terminals are always included.  Gnuplot 3.7 would also use 

 AMIGA ATARI MTOS _Macintosh DJGPP __ZTC__ PC NEXT APOLLO GPR IRIS MGR RGIP
 SCO SUN UIS UNIXPC UNIXPLOT GNUGRAPH DEBUG

Note that for some term types (such as X11, or PM) additional binaries are
needed.  They should be available if gnuplot is already installed on your
system.

CHANGES
~~~~~~~
0.2: Test added.
0.3: Part of gnuplot3.5 distribution included to make it
	into turnkey installation, tested on OS/2, Solaris.
0.4: list_terms() added;
     interactive test for different terminals;
0.41:
     change_term_address(), term_tbl_address() added;

0.5:	uses Gnuplot 3.6pre built 340 (with a tiny patch, included);
	change_term returns 1 on success, 0 on failure;
0.51:	Does not need any change to Gnuplot source files.
0.55:	Updated to latest Gnuplot.h from PARI 2.0.13 (with do_init => init).
	setpointsize works now.
	set_gnuplot_fh() removed, replaced by plot_outfile_set().
	Updated to version 3.7.
	stdfn.c needed too...
	setpointsize(0.25) instead of pointsize().
	GD terminal was coring, since it required calling option before plot.
0.56:	Better docs, DEBUG terminal.
	Setup a line buffer for options() so that gnuplot error reporting
	works better.
	New functions plotsizes_scale(), term_init(), term_start_plot(),
	term_end_plot(), term_start_multiplot(), term_end_multiplot().
	New C API setup_gpshim().
	POD for Terminals.
0.5601: syscfg.h was not \n-terminated
	SET_OUTFILE() had wrong precedence of `,'.
0.57:	Updated to 3.7.1.  Gnuplot.h from PARI 2.0.17 used.
	New Makefile.PL option TRY_LIBS.
0.5701:	New function _term_descrs(), hash %description.
	A primitive support for direct-to-Tk drawing: create Tk
	canvas $c, call Term::Gnuplot::setcanvas($c), then use
	'tkcanvas' terminal with option 'tkperl_canvas'.  (Size is
	determined at the moment of doing set_options().)
0.5702:
	Add a check for gdCreateGif too;
	setcanvas was not exported;
	Change TERM_PUBLIC to 'extern' for our private functions in
	tkcanvas.trm.
	Make Tk serve events while in test.pl.
	BUGS with tkcanvas tests: Not realistic charcell/ticks sizes;
	    $ptk_canvas->delete($ptk_canvas->find('all')) if $ptk_canvas;
	segfaults; thus the canvas is not cleared between the iterations.

0.5703:
	$ptk_canvas->delete('all') works.  Go figure...
	Refcount the canvas.
	Off by one and 2 errors in the size of plotting area fixed.
	Same for offsets of plotting area (including borders).
	New make target gnuterm_dynamic to make loadable-at-runtime DLL.
	Now queries the font size and calculates ticks accordingly.
	Erase the canvas between builtin and Perl tests.

0.5704:
	Make x11 test optional if gnuplot_x11 is not on PATH.

0.90_38b_00:
	extract_help moved to ./utils/.
	Update to version 3.8b with applied mouse patch
	gnuplot-3709-Nov-01-99.diff by Piotr Mikulik.
	Make the x11 modified executable named gplt_x11b.
	Update to Gnuplot.h from GP/PARI 2.2.3.

0.90_38i_00:
	Updated to CVS state of 2002/09/05.
	Make a PM modified executable named gplpmdrb.
	Regenerate the POD.
	Allow a missing ',' at the end of the line in the docs
   [Uncompatible change: is not 1 any more!]
	New constant TEXT_VERTICAL - the argument to text_angle() to make
	    it vertical.  Exportable on the tag :JUSTIFY.
	test.pl now takes optional parameters, the terminal name and files;
            so one can
		perl -Mblib test.pl png test.png testperl.png
	New constants LT_BACKGROUND LT_AXIS LT_BLACK exportable
	    (on the tag :LINETYPES)
	Remove a leak in plot_outfile_set() [NO: segfaults in postscript...].
	SYNOPSIS was not mentioning linewidth(1.0) at the start - same for
	    test.pl; but it was mentioned later in the docs...  (Postscript
	    would misbehave on an output file change).
        fillbox() now will not segfault, but would die() if it is not
	    implemented.  Test suite now tests the following new wrappers methods:
		clear_box pattern_fill_box color_fill_box
	    (exportable on :METHODS).
	merge the patch to enable PIPE_IPC on OS/2 too.
	Fix the macro XPutPixel given double arg when expecting an int.
	New methods 		 make_gray_palette set_color previous_palette
				 filled_polygon put_right_justified_text
				 put_centered_text put_left_justified_text

0.90_38i_01:
	maybe_command_in_dirs() was removed from MakeMaker!!!
	File::Basename need to be used by Makefile.PL...
	remove file 'test_x11' on clean.
	distribute as bz2.
	[XXX??? dumb terminal on DOSISH systems rights in binary mode???]
	[XXX??? "drv: " messages from PM driver???]
	[XXX??? Pressing a key in PM terminal won't switch to the
		text mode window; only SPACE works... ???]
	[XXX??? PM terminal does not implement density and pattern for fillbox]

0.90_38i_02:
	Add mousing.c and .h from Term-Gnuplot-0.90_38b_00.
	Started to code USE_ACTIVE_EVENTS in PM driver.
	[XXX??? PM terminal does not show if event_passive is changed
		to initialized: static int events_active = 1]
	Dummy enable_mousetracking().
