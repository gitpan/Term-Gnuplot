WHAT
~~~~

This module is intended for low-resolution or high-resolution graphics
using gnuplot low-level functions. Documentation is at the start of
the .pm file.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
You may need to edit LIBS line in Makefile.PL, and INC and CFLAGS lines
in gnuterm/Makefile.PL (as based on the included platform-specific
makefiles and READMEs in ./gnuterm directory), but if not, this should work:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
		(Check whether you are satisfied with the result.)
	make install

If you needed some changed, and can automate them, please send patches to
the address below.

Note that for some term types (such as X11, or PM) additional binaries are
needed.  They should be available if gnuplot runs on your platform already.
