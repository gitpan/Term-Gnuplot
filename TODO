The file tree does not contain the src/win subdirectory of gnuplot.

Somebody with access to Win* machines should copy these files to gnuterm/win,
and tune gnuterm/Makefile.PL to compile them...

=====================

On OS/2 x_exec requires USE_MOUSE: in fact pm_exec require OS2_IPC,
and x_exec does not tolerate it...

Retrofit tkcanvas.c into the new version;

tkcanvas test was not working on OS/2;

PM terminal leaks fill color between fillbox()
[see the commented fillbox() call in test.pl].

X terminal does not take fillpattern % 7...  GD does.

Buffer overrun in PM's setpalette().

use strict, -w

use_maxcolors : the terminal driver will not use more colors than that
		(to create another palette later...)
positive:	unused (other than translate gray -> 1-gray before setcolor).

gif: now separate from png (old gd)...

-DPIPE_IPC needed outside of OS/2.
==> x11.trm: mouse_setting not accessible

x11 exec, missing symbols:
   pipe_died
   pipe_died_handler
   GE_pending
   buffered_output_pending

PM term leaks if PIPE_IPC on server start (input_from...)
