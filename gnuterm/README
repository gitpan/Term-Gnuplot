This is the official North American distribution site for gnuplot, a
general-purpose plotting program that works with many output devices. 

gnuplot3.5.tar.Z   is the full GNUPLOT 3.5 release.
gp34to35.shar.Z    is an upgrade from 3.4 to 3.5.

gnuplot-latex.shar is a set of handy scripts and macros for use with latex. 

gnut2p.tar.Z is a translator to take old gnutex input files and make
gnuplot2.0 files; it should also work with gnuplot3.5.

DOS34.zip has 386 and 486 precompiled binaries for gnuplot 3.4 (not
3.5). This is explained further in DOS34.txt. 

------------------
GNUFIT incorporates a nonlinear least squares fit mechanism into GNUPLOT. The
fit uses the Marquardt-Levenberg-algorithm for fitting and the GNUPLOT
function evaluation mechanism for calculation. Thus it remains relatively
small. It offers all advantages of fitting every rather complex-formulated
function you can create with GNUPLOT (including complex calculation).
